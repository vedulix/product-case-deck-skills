- Quick Start section reorganized for 12-platform listing

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- Notion integration: AI Custom Skill template for in-Notion text quality checks (`notion/ru-text-notion-skill.md`)
- Notion MCP workflow documentation (Claude Code + Notion MCP server)
- OpenClaw support: native plugin manifest (`openclaw.plugin.json`)

### Changed
- Platform support expanded: Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Cursor, OpenClaw, Notion
- Consistent digit formatting across all README files (English: `~1,040`; Russian: `~1 040`)

### Fixed
- Claude Code install: added `@claude-community` marketplace suffix
- Codex CLI: replaced non-existent `codex install` with interactive `/plugins` browser
- Cursor: added `/add-plugin` as primary install method, manual copy as fallback
- OpenClaw: corrected install syntax to `clawhub:ru-text` format
- Notion: fixed keyboard shortcut (removed wrong `Ctrl+J`), corrected menu path
- Typography: fixed closing lapki quote U+0022 → U+201C in SKILL.md and Notion template

## [1.5.1] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- Reference files unreachable for marketplace users: Claude could not resolve relative paths in SKILL.md and commands because the Skill tool does not provide a base directory
- Used `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` (official Claude Code variable, substituted inline in skill content) for absolute paths to reference files, with Glob fallback for cross-platform compatibility

### Changed
- SKILL.md and commands now use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/ru-text/references/<filename>` paths instead of unresolvable relative markdown links
- Trimmed redundant quality checklist items from SKILL.md (covered by reference files)
