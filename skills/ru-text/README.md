**Languages:** English | [Русский](README.ru.md)

**Russian text quality plugin for Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Cursor, JetBrains, and [6 more platforms](#quick-start)** — typography, information style, editorial standards, UX writing, and business correspondence.

~1,040 independently formulated rules informed by 16 canonical Russian-language sources. All formulations are original — no verbatim quotes, full attribution.

## Acknowledgments

This plugin exists because a handful of people decided that Russian text on the internet deserves better. They wrote the books, built the tools, maintained the guides, and set the standards that thousands of editors, writers, and designers now rely on every day. Their work fundamentally changed how Russian text is written, formatted, and read on screens. I am deeply grateful to every one of them. If this plugin saves you time, please buy their books and use their tools — they earned it.


## What it does

ru-text gives your AI coding assistant a deep understanding of Russian text quality. It auto-activates when the assistant produces or edits Russian text, applying typography rules instantly and loading domain-specific knowledge on demand.

Works with Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Cursor, Cline, JetBrains (Junie), Continue.dev, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, OpenClaw, and Notion.

- **~1,040 rules** across 7 domains, packed into 9 reference files + addenda
- **Auto-activation** — no need to remember to turn it on
- **Covers everything** — from em dashes and guillemets to UX microcopy and business email tone
- **Non-dogmatic** — your explicit style request always overrides default rules

## Use cases

**This README.** Every dash, quote, and space you see here follows the plugin's own rules. This document was written with ru-text active.

**UX microcopy.** Writing buttons, errors, empty states for a Russian app. The plugin loads 217 UX rules: "Отмена" not "Нет", error structure (what happened + what to do), placeholders as examples, not instructions.

**Business email.** Drafting an email to colleagues or clients. The plugin kills bureaucratic language ("довожу до сведения" → "сообщаю"), structures subject + first sentence + call to action, and suggests respectful tone without being servile.

**Landing page copy.** Writing an "About" section for an IT company. The plugin replaces cliches ("команда профессионалов", "индивидуальный подход") with specific facts and numbers.

**README and documentation.** Writing docs for an open-source project in Russian. Proper typography (guillemets, em dashes, non-breaking spaces), no filler words, clear inverted-pyramid structure.

**Text quality scoring.** Want to know how your text measures up? `/ru-text:ru-score` evaluates text across 5 dimensions (typography, clarity, grammar, structure, reader precision) and returns a 0.0–10.0 score with specific issues per dimension.

**AI agent quality.** Building AI features in your product? Uncertain how the agent will phrase responses in Russian? ru-text ensures predictable, high-quality Russian text from any Claude-powered agent: consistent typography, no bureaucratic language, reader-first structure.
